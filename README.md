# 90DaysOfDataOps

Here goes something else! 

I have been hearing the term DataOps amongst the world of Generative AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Engineerings so I wanted to get my hands dirty and try something out in this field. 

If you are new here, I started a project called #90DaysOfDevOps which has ran for over 3 seasons talking about all things DevOps and DevSecOps. This project spanned GitHub, a website, and YouTube and seemed to resonate with many in the community. That project merely started as a me learning in public and getting to grips with the fundamental areas of DevOps. I want to take this same approach here with DataOps. 

I have found a fantastic resource that I am starting with (Data Alchemy)[https://www.skool.com/data-alchemy] which has around 30k members and this stems from some fantastic resources from (Dave Ebbelaar)[https://www.youtube.com/@daveebbelaar] 

I want to be very clear here! This project #90DaysOfDataOps as with #90DaysOfDevOps is in no way for my own financial gain. It is a community learning resource but I want to affiliate the hard work by the people in the community within this. There will be many people creating fantastic learning material across many different genres of Data that I want to bring to one place. 

Day 1 - Learning the basics of DataOps 

I am going to start writing my notes here and then later on we will get into a more project framework later on. 

The Data Alchemy course starts by talking about the "The art and science of transforming data into information" and how this high level description could span many different roles. I am not looking for a role but just looking to bolster my learning journey. 

There are then 7 Steps defined that I am sure we are going to get into more detail on: 

- Set up an environment
- Python (We have some great foundational content on Python within the #90DaysOfDevOps this is a good chance to review and update this content).
- Git (We also have a section on this within the #90DaysOfDevOps project, another one to review and update).
- Hands-On scenarios and projects
- Specialisation
- Continous Learning
- Monetise (As mentioned this is not my goal so I wont be covering this step)

I am excited to get started here and continue the learning journey. I will be adding resources and notes here.
